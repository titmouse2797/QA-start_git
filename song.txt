MAMA SAID
YOUâ€™RE A PRETTY GIRL
WHAT'S IN YOUR HEAD
IT DOESN'T MATTER
BRUSH YOUR HAIR
FIX YOUR TEETH
WHAT YOU WEAR
IS ALL THAT MATTERS
JUST ANOTHER STAGE
PAGEANT THE PAIN AWAY

THIS TIME I'M GONNA TAKE THE CROWN
WITHOUT FALLING DOWN DOWN DOWN

PRETTY HURTS
WE SHINE THE LIGHT ON WHATEVER'S WORST
PERFECTION IS A DISEASE OF A NATION
PRETTY HURTS, PRETTY HURTS
PRETTY HURTS
